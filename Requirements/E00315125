Requirements exercise 1 (Ball Game):

Ball needs to be able to bounce off any one side of the screen.

If ball goes into corner of the screen, then one side will be selected at random as side of impact to reflect ball.

Ball needs to bounce off any user drawn object larger than 3 pixels. 

User drawn objects 3 pixels and less should not cause the ball to bounce off object.

 Ball should pass through object if 3 pixels or less in size.

User drawn object must be drawn with the mouse.
