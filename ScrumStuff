Sprint planning: Recurring 1st day of each sprint, time box for 15 minutes the first day of the sprint 
    Revisit sprint goal; update as necessary
    Select the Product Backlog user stories to be delivered in the sprint (includes a review/discussion of the stories/estimation)
    Break them down as necessary to <4 hour tasks
Daily Scrum/Standup: Recurring daily during sprint, time box for 15 minutes. Add a 16th minute for additional collaboration, 
time box for 15 more minutes and dismiss any team members not necessary for discussion
    Each member updates the team on tasks completed (DoD)
    Talks about obstacles (if any) preventing them from completing said tasks
    This may result in new tasks being added to the sprint backlog
    And is an indicator that the task may not have been ready to pull into a sprint
    Selects a new task or two (no more than they can complete between now and the next stand up) from the sprint backlog


The last hour of the last class day of a sprint
Backlog grooming: max 30 minutes, (not limited to the scope of a single sprint; meant to ensure the highest priority backlog 
items are detailed enough and estimated so they can be used in Sprint Planning; 
ideally, enough stories are detailed for at least 2 sprintâ€™s worth of work so you have enough for the next sprint plus more 
if you can pull additional work into the next sprint)
Sprint review: max 15 minutes; this is akin to acceptance testing with the customer/product owner.
Sprint retrospective: Remainder of the last hour (min 15 minutes). team discusses changes to daily routines, definition of 
done, ways to improve (e.g. training and or pair programming participants).
