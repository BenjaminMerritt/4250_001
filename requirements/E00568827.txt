Mandatory:
The ball must bounce off at a predictable angle, use the formulas for angle of incidence
When the player draws an obstacle, track each pixel that they touch and mark them as solid
Need to define the width and height of the screen
Need to define the size of the ball (radius)
Need to define the speed of the ball (does it speed up?)
Need to be able to detect when the mouse is drawing (click and drag? just drag?)

Optional:
The ball will start by moving in a random direction
When the player draws an obstacle, do not keep it unless it spans more than three pixels. This will make the check for small obstacles unnecessary
If the ball is ever out of bounds, reset it to the center
