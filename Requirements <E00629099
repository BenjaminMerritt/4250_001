Requirements <E00629099

Functional Requirements:

1.	User-Drawn Obstacles:
•	The program should allow the user to draw obstacles on the screen using the mouse.
•	Obstacles must be larger than 3 pixels in width and height to be considered for collision detection.
2.	Bouncing Ball:
•	A ball should be displayed on the screen.
•	The ball should move continuously in a specific direction.
3.	Collision Detection:
•	The program should detect collisions between the ball and user-drawn obstacles.
•	Collisions should change the ball's direction and prevent it from passing through obstacles.
4.	Screen Boundaries:
•	The program should detect collisions between the ball and the edges of the screen.
•	Collisions with screen boundaries should reverse the ball's direction.
5.	User Interaction:
•	Users should be able to start and stop the simulation.
•	Users should be able to clear the screen of obstacles and reset the ball's position and velocity.
User Interface (UI) Requirements:
1.	Drawing Interface:
•	Provide a canvas or drawing area where users can draw obstacles.
•	Include controls for starting and stopping the simulation.
2.	Ball Visualization:
•	Display the ball as a visible object on the canvas.
3.	Obstacle Interaction:
•	Provide a way for users to interact with obstacles, such as selecting and deleting them.
4.	Feedback:
•	Provide visual feedback to indicate when collisions occur (e.g., change the color of colliding objects).
Performance Requirements:
1.	Real-time Interaction:
•	The program should provide real-time responsiveness to user actions, including obstacle drawing and simulation control.
2.	Smooth Animation:
•	Ensure that the animation of the ball's movement and collision reactions is smooth and visually pleasing.
